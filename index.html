                As Bangladesh transitions towards a new era of leadership, the future of digital transformation remains a critical priority, especially if we wish to position the country as a thought leader in our peer group.Over the last two decades, Bangladesh has made significant strides in transforming its digital landscape. Policies supporting internet access, e-governance, and ICT education have helped lay the foundation for a more tech-savvy, digitally inclusive nation.
            <br>
                With a rapidly growing ICT sector, the country has seen notable improvements in financial inclusion, digital healthcare, education, and e-commerce. Successful initiatives like mobile financial services (MFS), digitised government services (e-GP), and the growth of tech startups have contributed to Bangladesh's emergence as a rising player in the digital economy.
            <br>             
                Nevertheless, in a report published in July, Bangladesh scores a mere 62 out of 100 in the ICT Development Index tracked by the International Telecommunication Union. This is well below the global average of 74.8, and even below the average score for other lower middle-income countries.
             <br>          
                Tracking a basket of categories such as connectivity and digital inclusion, use of digital services and web traffic, e-commerce, artificial intelligence, digitalised government, education, health, governance, cybersecurity and more, the index provides relevant aspirational goals for any country vying for excellence in digital infrastructure.
